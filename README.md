README.md 
## Reproducibility & Local Setup

This project is fully reproducible. Internal developer notes covering local setup, daily restart, and database rebuild steps are documented separately and kept outside recruiter-facing documentation.

## Project Design Decisions

### Orchestration
This project intentionally avoids automated orchestration to prioritise transparency, reproducibility, and debuggability, while keeping all transformations fully script-based and ready for future automation.
